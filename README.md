### Design choices
1. Firstly, I did some competitors research. 
I discovered that the competition often displays their product images bigger (around 2/3 of the whole product card) and provide less information of the product in the "all products" display.
As this had to be a quick project, I decided to trust their research and did the same.
2. Websites that sell products also offer to a client a way to save their item for later purchase. That is why I added a small hear that turns green if clicked. This would indicate, that the client has saved this item for later viewing or purchasing.
3. I decided to make the prices appear as a 2nd or even 3rd most important part the client would look at.
I did that by making it more subtle.
4. I used the current color palette of Unisport.
5. I do not own "Proxima Nova" font, therefore I used a free similar font called "Montserrat".

### Code
1. No Libraries. Why?
While libraries help us speed up the process of coding, it does often take the freedom in design choices.
Having that freedom was of a high value to me for this project. 
That is the reason why I did not use any libraries. 
2. Keeping it light. This was a small project, so I wanted to keep it light. That is why I used only the latest version of HTML, JS and CSS.
3. I decided to use the "template" tag to holds a card styled in a way that the product would later be shown.
Content inside the tag is not rendered until it is copied, populated with the data needed and appended to a html element (parent), by using JS.
